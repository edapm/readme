### Hi there 👋

<!--
**forgenst/forgenst** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Lunchbenching**, which I'm building with Django
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, and revising my JavaScript
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web-based projects, especially ones built with Django
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to deploy a web application
- 💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, Python, and Django - but there's probably better people to ask!
- 📫 How to reach me: [ed@forgenst.com](mailto:ed@forgenst.com)
