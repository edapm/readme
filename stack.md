# Picnicspot - Help choosing a Stack
Hi, If you're reading this, it's probably because you saw my profile README. I'm currently looking at which web stack is best for building a full-stack application on.

I'm currently favouring **ASP.NET**, **ReactJS** and **Kotlin Native** or **React Native**.

## Other choices include

- MERN stack
- Django

Any other suggestions please email me at [picnicspot@forgenst.com](mailto:picnicspot@forgenst.com).

Thanks,
Ed
